<a name="windowsetup"></a><h2>The Kon windows</h2>

<img src=MainWindow.gif vspace=10><br>

<p>The kon window is divided into specific parts:.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A tabbed control where you edit your text files.</li>
  <li>Optionally a section browser which you use for navigating quickly in the
      code text.</li>
  <li>A messages window where search results and information about
      running K-programs is displayed.</li>
  <li>A command prompt where you can enter K-commands.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kon may contain several text editor windows, but with only one 
visible at a time. They are then contained within the tab-control.</p>

<p>You can switch between the windows by any of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Left-click on the appropriate tab.</li>
  <li>Right-click on the tab field to popup a menu where you can choose a file.</li>
  <li>Press Alt-PageDown to swith to the next window, or press  Alt-PageUp for 
      the previous one.</li>
  <li>Press Ctrl-Tab or Ctrl-Shift-Tab for similar operation.</li> 
  <li>Jump directly to a window, by selecting Window from the main menu, and 
      then choose the window you want to jump to.</li>
</ul>

<a name="editandmove"></a><h2>Editing and navigating in the text</h2>

<p>Kon is inspired by the WordStar word processor, which also many
other texteditors have been influenced by. The idea behind the keystrokes used
by the WordStar key-bindings is that you should be able to reach all commands
from the alpha-numeric keyboard and without having to leave your 
finger setting.</p>

<p>Not all of the key bindings in WordStar has been implemented, for example
the cursor diamond and some keystrokes which conflict with Windows common 
keystrokes.</p>

<p>Note however, that it is very easy to implement your own keyboard bindings
in case you wish to modify the default bindings!</p>

<p>Entering and moving around in the text is straight forward. Kon is by default
using "virtual-spaces" which means you can move the cursor beyond line ends. 
This can be very useful, but can be turned off to implement a more traditional 
behaviour.</p>

<p>Marking text is done by using the mouse, or by using the shift-cursor keys.
</p>

<p>Kon also has a "column-block" mode, where you work with block selections
as columns, as opposed to a string of text. This can be very useful when
modifying text arranged in columns.</p>

<p>Kon has a mode <a href="prefs.html#editor.html">"persistent blocks"</a> 
where block marking is not reset when you move the cursor. This can sometimes 
be useful, but is not set by default.
</p>

<p>There is also an undo/redo function. Every change you make to the text
can be undone, and redone. The size of the undo buffer is 
<a href="prefs.html#editor.html">configurable</a>.</p>

<a name="wordwrap"></a><h2>Word wrap</h2>

<p>Kon has support for word wrapping in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Using soft line breaks</b>. A paragraph is ended by a normal CR+LF (or LF) 
    sequence and linebreaks within the paragraph is represented with a CR+CR+LF
    sequence. This is the default behaviour, but when saving the file, line 
    ends will be in non-standard format. To avoid this, the line-endings can be 
    removed (which is the usual way this is handled by text-editors) or 
    "finalized" by replacing the soft line breaks with hard line breaks.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Using hard line breaks</b>. A paragraph is ended by two line breaks
    in sequence. A "soft" line break is represented by a single line break.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Word wrap settings can be reached from the main menu: Edit->Word wrap.</p>

<a name="hexeditor"></a><h3>Hex editor</h3>

<img src=KonHex.gif><br><br>

<p>The Hex view is useful for editing or viewing binary data. You can modify
the binary data as characters, or by modifying the hex code for each
character.</p>

<p>The view may also be usable for viewing text-only data as well: Sometimes
the textlines may be too long for Kon to handle in the Ascii view. Switching
to the Hex view lets you inspect all text in a file. It can also be useful for
distincting and replacing for example NULL-characters to spaces, or for 
inspecting which line ending sequence is used in a file.

<p>You can switch between the Ascii-field and the Hex-field by using the 
TAB-key, or by simply clicking with the mouse where you want to edit.</p>

<p>Be careful when editing binary data! Kon allows for insertion or deletion of 
text which may corrupt data, since binary data often is dependent on absolute 
positions of text in the file.</p>

<a name="macros"></a><h2>Macro recording</h2>

<p>The macro recording in Kon is very powerful. The simplest way to use macros
is to simply record them by pressing Ctrl-Alt-R (the letter 'R' will be 
displayed in the status bar to indicate macro recording) and then input the 
sequence you want to repeat. This may include dialogs: The dialogs wont be 
displayed at playback, only the results from the dialog interaction will be 
used. To end the recording, press Ctrl-Alt-R again.</p>

<p>To playback the macro, simply press Ctrl-Alt-P.</p>

<p>The macro itself is a K-program. After the macro is recorded you can
edit and execute it in a number of ways.</p>

<p>Apart from saving it to disk, and then include it in a module which is
loaded at startup, you can also edit it directly by using the clipboard:</p>

<p>You can copy the recorded macro to the clipboard, paste it in a editor
window, edit it, and copy it back to the clipboard. You can then choose to
execute the macro from the clipboard. You can of course also write macros 
directly which you copy to the clipboard and execute from there.</p>

<p>All of these functions can be reached from the main menu: 
Choose Edit->Macro.</p>

<p>Saving a macro in any of these ways can be a good starting point for
writing a small K-program.</p>

<a name="uncommon"></a><h2>Some not so common features</h2>

<p>Kon represents the file internally as a stream of data. This lets you for
instance see which byte-position you are standing at in the file: Simply switch 
to hex view and see where you are positioned. You can also always jump to a 
specific byte position by pressing Ctrl-p and specify to which position you 
want to jump.</p>

<p>You can also jump directly to a line by pressing Ctrl-j.</p>

<p>It is possible to show the position in the file relative another 
position. Pressing Ctrl-p will reset the position indicator in the window's
lower left with a zero. Moving backwards will show a negative position 
relative the position where you pressed Ctrl-p, and positive when moving
the cursor after the marked position.</p>

<p>You can store the position you're currently standing at in any of these 
ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By pressing Ctrl-PageDown your current position will be stored on a stack.
      Pressing Ctrl-PageUp will restore the latest position from the stack.</li>
  <li>You can store a position in a "slot" numbered from 0 to 9, by pressing
      Ctrl-K-&lt;slot number&gt;. You retrieve the position in a slot by 
      pressing Ctrl-Q-&lt;slot number&gt;.</li>
  <li>By pressing Ctrl-Space at the places you wish to store, and then press
      Ctrl-Up or Ctrl-Down to jump between them.</li>
</ul>

<p>All positions will be marked in the left column of the editor window (if the
left margin is set to be visible).</p>

<a name="search"></a><h2>Searching for text</h2>

<img src=Find1.gif><br><br>

<p>Kon can search for text in the currently active file, the files opened in
the editor, or on files on disk.</p>

<p>For a simple search, just type the text you want to search for in the
"Text to find" field, and then press "Search current buffer".</p>

<p>To search in more than one file, select the tab "Multiple files". Then
either type the files you want to search (a search pattern works fine. You may
separate different files, search patterns using semi-colons.) Also fill in
the directory you want to search in or press the "current dir" button.</p>

<p>You can also check "buffers only" and select which opened files you want to
search in</p>

<p>For a more comprehensive description of search click 
<a href="searchreplace.html">here</a></p>

<a name="replace"></a><h2>Search and replace text</h2>

<p>Works very similar to search. <i>Note that replacing in several files
on disk is NOT undoable!</i></p>

<p>For a more comprehensive description of search and replace click 
<a href="searchreplace.html">here</a></p>

<a name="unicode"></a><h2>Unicode</h2>

<p>Internally, Kon works with 8-bit characters. This choice has been made for
Kon to work properly as a hex-editor also. Kon does however handle Unicode
files to a certain extent. Most Unicode files can be converted into an Ansi
equivalent and Kon attempts to do that when a file is loaded. If the content
cannot be determined (Unicode files should have a leading byte sequence
indicating which type of Unicode the file is encoded with), conversion can 
be done within the editor (from the "View"-menu, "convert from ..."). When 
the file later on is saved, it can be saved in Ansi or Unicode. This is 
specified in the "Save as.." dialog. See also <a href="prefs.html#misc">
Misc settings</a></p>

<p>For editing Unicode files with a mix of languages not contained in the
default codepage, Kon is probably not the right editor to use, at least not
with this version. In time this may change.</p>
