<h1>Programming in K</h1>

<p>Kon is equipped with a very flexible programming language called K. 
K has a C-like syntax but differs from C in many ways. 
A few of the features in K not found in C are:</p>

<ul type=disc>
    <li>
				K is an untyped language. The type of a variable is decided when 
		    it is assigned a value, but the type can can change during 
				execution.
		</li>
    <li>
        K has no pointers, all memory handling is handled by the K itself.
		</li>
    <li>
        K does not need to be compiled, K code can be run immediately 
				from within Kon.
		</li>
</ul>

<p>Running K-code directly from within Kon is very useful and offers the 
possibility to try and execute semi-advanced K-code directly from the 
commandline (or even from the clipboard) without having to exit Kon for 
compiling and then load the module.</p>

<p>K is very tightly integrated with Kon, and much of Kon is written in K.</p>

<h2>K quickstart</h2>

<i>Please note that some programming knowledge is required! No knowledge of C is required, but it will probably help.</i>

<p>Let's start by defining a function in K:</p>

<pre class="code">testFunction( a, b )
{
    insertString( a );
    insertString( b );
}</pre>
 

<p>Note that as opposed to C, no type declarations is defined.</p>

<p>This function takes two parameters, a and b. The code within the 
function calls the "insertString" function with each of a and b as 
parameters. Every command in K is followed by a semicolon, as in C.</p>

<p>Supposing that this function is available in Kon, we call it from the 
commandline:</p>

<pre class="code">testFunction( "A number: ", 123 );</pre>

<p>This will call "testFunction" with parameter a = "A number: " and b=123. 
Note that parameter a is a string (by enclosing "A number: " with quotation 
marks), and parameter b is a number.</p>

<p>The output will look like:</p>

<pre class="code">A number: 123</pre>

<p>Now suppose that we wanted to output the character resulting from the 
ASCII-code 123 instead. Define the function:</p>

<pre class="code">testFunction2( a, b )
{
    insertString( a );

    if( isInteger( b ) )
        insertString( toChar( b ) );
    else
        insertString( b );
}</pre>

<p>This function will test if the type of b is an integer. If so, output 
the resulting character from that ASCII-code, otherwise just output b.</p>

<p>Now call the function from the command line:</p>

<pre class="code">testFunction2( "A character: ", 123 );</pre>

<p>The output will look like:</p>

<pre class="code">A character: {</pre>

<p>That's nice, but we can improve it. We want to display which ASCII-code 
the character is. We can do that without redefining the function:</p>

<pre class="code">testFunction2( "Character for ASCII-code " @ 123 @ ": ", 123 );</pre>

<p>The '@' operator means "concatenate (as) strings". The output will 
look like:</p>

<pre class="code">Character for ASCII-code 123: {</pre>

<p>You should have a basic feel for K now. Let's have a look at a more formal definition.</p>

<h3>K language definition</h3>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>K is case sensitive.</p>

<p>Every statement should end with a semi-colon, as in C.</p>

<p>Comments are placed after "//" as in C++. Block comments are not used.</p>

<pre class='code'>print( a );    // Prints the variable a to the message window</pre>

<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>Variables can be globally or locally defined. A variable is:</p>

<ul type=disc>
    <li>
       Global if it is declared outside the scope of a function
		</li>
    <li>
    	 Local if it is declared within a function
		</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Global variables can be accessed by any K-function. Local variables 
can ne accessed within the K-function where the variable is declared only.</p>

<p>A function can be declared anywhere in the code.</p>
 
<h3>Strings</h3>

<p>A string is enclosed in " or ' marks. In order to have non-printable 
characters within a string or a quoatation mark, a literal character is 
defined, the backslash ("\"). If a \ is within a string, the next character 
is handled in a special way. (Note! This is only if the string is defined 
in the K-code. A genereted string can have any characters except the 
NULL character within.)</p>
 
<h4>Backslash character constants</h4>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="70%">
	<tr>
		<td>Constant</td>
		<td>Meaning</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>\n</td>
		<td>
			Linefeed character (Ascii 10)
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>\r</td>
		<td>
			Carriage Return character (Ascii 13)
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>\t</td>
		<td>
			Tab character (Ascii 9)
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>\\</td>
		<td>
			Backslash
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>\'</td>
		<td>
			Quote
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>\"</td>
		<td>
			Double quote
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>
 
<p>It is possible to access individual characters within a string using 
array syntax:</p>

<pre class='code'>a = "abcdef"
a[1] ) == "b"
</pre>

<h3>Arrays</h3>

<p>An array can hold variables of any type. They may be of any dimension. 
Arrays are zero indexed.</p>

<pre class='code'>a = [1, "abc", 2, [3, "def", [4, "ghi"]]];

a[0] == 1;
a[1] == "abc"
a[3][0] == 3
a[3][1] == "def"
a[3][2][1] == "ghi"</pre>
 
<h3>Operators</h3>

<h4>Assignment operator</h4>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="70%">
	<tr>
		<td>Operator</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>=</td>
		<td>
			Sets a variable equal to an expression
		</td>
 	</tr>
</table>

<h4>Arithmetical operators</h4>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="70%">
	<tr>
		<td>Operator</td>
		<td>Meaning</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>+</td>
		<td>
			Addition. This operator has effect on strings also, see 
			"string operators" for an explanation.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>-</td>
		<td>
			Subtraction. Also used as a unary operator: -a = -1 * a
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>*</td>
		<td>
			Multiplication
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>/</td>
		<td>
			Division
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>%</td>
		<td>
			Modulus
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>++, --</td>
		<td>
			<p>Incement and decrement a value: a++ is equal to a = a + 1. </p>
			<p>The position of ++ or , gives different results:</p>
<pre class='code'>a = 1;
b = ++a;

gives b = 2 and a = 2. However:

a = 1;
b = a++;

gives b = 1 and a = 2</pre>

<h4>String operators</h4>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 width="70%">
	<tr>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>@</td>
		<td>
			Concatenates as strings. If at least one of the expressions is not 
			a string, it is converted to a string before concatenating.
<pre class='code'>"abc" @ 123

gives

"abc123"</pre>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>+</td>
		<td>
			Concatenates. If both expressions are strings, they are simply 
			concatenated. If one of the expressions is a number, the other 
			expression is examined if it is possible to convert to a number. 
			If so, it works like the arithmetical + operator.

<pre class='code'>"abc" + "def"

gives

"abcdef"</pre>

<pre class='code'>"123" + 1

gives

124</pre>

<pre class='code'>"123a" + 1

gives

"123a1"</pre>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>A functions is defined as:</p>

<pre class='definition'>functionName( arg1, arg2, ,, argN )
{
    // Function body
    return returnvalue;   // 'return' is optional
}</pre>

<p>The return statement can be executed from anywhere in the function, 
and returns a value to the caller.</p>
 
<h4>Call-by-reference</h4>

<p>Parameters to a function can be references (Call-by-reference) by 
placing an '&amp;' before the parameter in the function definition. 
This means that instead of passing the value of a variable as a 
parameter to the function, a reference to the variable is passed instead. 
Modifying the value of the parameter in the function, will modify the 
variable itself, instead of a copy.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class='code'>testReference( &amp;arg )
{
    print( "arg is at testReference entry: " @ arg );
    arg = 2;
    print( "arg value within testReference, after modifying: " @ arg );
}

test()
{
    a = 1;
    print( "Value of a before being passed to testReference: " @ a );
    testReference( a );
    print( "Value of a after being passed to testReference: " @ a );
}</pre>

<p>Running test() will give the following output:</p>

<pre class='code'>Value of a before being to testReference: 1
arg is at testReference entry: 1
arg value within testReference, after modifying: 2
Value of a after being passed to testReference: 2</pre>

 
<h3>if statement</h3>

<p>An if-statement is defined as:</p>

<pre class='definition'>if( expression )
    statement1;
else
    statement2;</pre> 

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class='code'>if( a == 1 )
    print( "a is 1!" );
else
{
    print( "a is not 1!" );
    print( "Do something else." );
}</pre>
 
<h3>switch statement</h3>

<p>The switch statement compares an expression agains a list of 
expressions. (As opposed to C, where the statement can only be compared 
to constants.)</p>

<p>A switch statement is defined as:</p>

<pre class='definition'>switch( expression )
{
    case expression1:
        statement1;
        statement2;
        .
        statementn;
        break;
    case expression2:
        statement1;
        statement2;
        .
        statementn;
        break;
    default:
        statement1;
        statement2;
        .
        statementn;
}</pre>

<p>If the break statement is omitted, the execution continues to the 
next case statement until either a break or the end of switch is reached.</p>

<pre class='code'>a = 12;

switch( a )
{
    case 6 * 2 :
    case 3 * 4 :
        print( "a is 12" );
        break;
    default :
        print( "a is not 12" );
}</pre>

<h3>for loop</h3>

<p>A for loop is defined as:</p>

<pre class='definition'>for(initialization; condition; increment)
    statement;</pre>

<p>Initialization is a statement initializing the loop control variable(s). 
Condition is an expression that determines when the loop exits. 
Increment defines how the loop variable(s) change each time the loop 
is repeated.</pre>

<p>Statement can be empty, a single statement or a block of statement 
within { }.</p>

<p>Example of a for-loop:</p>

<pre class='code'>a = 10;
for( b = 0; b < a; b++ )
    print( b );</pre>
 
<p>This loop will initalize the variable b to 0. It will then loop until 
b is equal to a. Every loop b is incremented by one.</p>

<p>A variant of the for loop is possible by using the comma operator:</p>

<pre class='code'>for( a = 0, b = 0; a + b < 10; a++, b += 2 )
    print( a @ ", " @ b );</pre>

<p>This loop will initialize a and b to zero, loop until a+b = 10 and 
for each loop a is incremented by one, and b by 2.</p>

<h3>while loop</h3>

<p>The while loop is defined as:</p>

<pre class='definition'>while( condition )
    statement;</pre>
 
<h3>do-while loop</h3>

<p>The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, except that the 
condition is tested at the bottom of the loop.</p>

<pre class='definition'>do
    statement;
while( condition );</pre>
 
<h3>break statement</h3>

<p>The break statement can be used to terminate a loop.</p>
 
<h3>continue statement</h3>

<p>The continue statement is used to continue the iteration of the 
loop, skipping any code between the continue statement and the 
condition testing.</p>

<pre class='code'>a = 1;

while( a < 5 )
{
    a++;
    if( a == 3 ) continue;
    print( a  );
}</pre>


<p>gives</p>


<pre class='code'>2
4
5</pre>
